## Usage

### Configuring the Extension

You can configure the extension in your Cursor settings:

```json
{
  "taskTracker.taskFilePath": "data/task_list1.json",
  "taskTracker.implementationDir": "implementations"
}
```

### Viewing Tasks

1. Click the checklist icon in the activity bar to show the Task Tracker view
2. Alternatively, click the "Tasks" button in the status bar

The task view shows:
- Task ID and title
- Current status (using icons)
- Progress statistics

### Working with Tasks

- **Open a task**: Click on a task to open its implementation file
- **Create implementation**: If the implementation file doesn't exist, you'll be prompted to create it
- **Refresh tasks**: Click the refresh button in the view title bar
- **Generate report**: Click the report button to create a detailed Markdown report

### Task Status Updates

Task status is updated automatically:
- Creating an implementation file sets status to "In Progress"
- You can manually update status by editing the `task_list1.json` file

## Task File Format

The extension expects a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "task_id": "F1.1",
    "title": "Support Multi-Connector Detection",
    "goal": "Support environments with more than one ready connector",
    "definition_of_done": [
      "Auto-select connector if only one is `.ready`",
      "Render dropdown or modal selector if multiple available"
    ],
    "estimated_time": "20â€“30 min",
    "dependencies": "Base connect UI",
    "ui_behavior": "Show selector if multiple connectors detected",
    "status": "Not Started"
  }
]
```
