# Task List App

A simple task management web application built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- View a list of tasks
- Mark tasks as "in progress" by clicking on them
- Mark tasks as completed with a checkmark
- Persistence between page reloads using localStorage
- Toast notifications for status updates
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Integration with Cursor IDE for task implementation 

## Usage

Simply open `code/index.html` in any modern web browser to use the application.

## Cursor IDE Integration

For a seamless development experience, we've included a Cursor IDE extension for tracking task implementation progress:

### Task Progress Tracker Extension

The extension provides visual tracking of task implementation progress directly within Cursor IDE:

#### Features

- View tasks from `task_list1.json` with status indicators
- Auto-track task status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- Create implementation files directly from the task view
- Generate progress reports in Markdown format
- Quick access via status bar

#### Installation

1. Navigate to the extension directory:
   ```
   cd cursor-task-tracker-extension
   ```

2. Install dependencies and build:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the extension:
   ```
   npm run install-extension
   ```

4. Restart Cursor IDE

#### Usage

1. Click the checklist icon in the activity bar
2. Click on any task to open/create its implementation file
3. Implementation files are automatically created in the `implementations` directory
4. Task status updates automatically as you work

## Project Structure

- `code/` - Main web application code
- `data/` - Task data JSON files
- `implementations/` - Task implementation files
- `cursor-task-tracker-extension/` - Cursor IDE extension for task tracking

## Task Implementation

When using the Task Tracker extension in Cursor IDE, clicking on a task will:

1. Open the implementation file if it exists
2. Offer to create a new implementation file if it doesn't exist
3. Update the task status to "In Progress"

Implementation files are created with the necessary documentation, including:
- Task details and goals
- Definition of done criteria
- Estimated time
- Dependencies
- Basic test structure
